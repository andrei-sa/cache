The project uses CMake.
Both in-source and out-of-source builds are supported, yet out-of-source building is generally recommended to localize the artifacts.

The code is cross-platform and can be used on any OS supporting C++14 and CMake.

To proceed with the out-of-source build on Linux, go to the project directory and execute:
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make -j<NUMBER_OF_BUILD_THREADS>

Libraries and executables will be found in the build/runtime/ directory.

In order for the unit tests to be built, GTest must be installed via CMake. In case it is, the 'tests' executable will be compiled in build/runtime/ following the steps above. Otherwise, tests will not be compiled.
